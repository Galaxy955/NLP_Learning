### TF-IDF
Reproduce TF-IDF algorithm based on mofanpy.com.

### Word2Vec
Use gensim package to create a CBOW model and a Skip-gram model.
Use sklearn.decomposition.PCA and matplotlib.pyplot to visualize the result of Word2Vec and get roughly the same result as MofanPython.

### BERT
Use PaddlePaddle to build a BERT classifier.
